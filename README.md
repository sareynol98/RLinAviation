# RLinAviation

## Execution instructions

This notebook can be run as-is in a Colab environment.
Any of the parameters can be changed, though it should be considered that the max size of a grid in Colab is approximately 30, due to RAM Limitations.

## Code Summary

**Authors**: Sarah Reynolds and Kamal Acharya

**Project**: The Use of Reinforcement Learning in Realistic Emergency Scenarios

**Code Description**: 

This code creates an environment that mimics an airplane and the airports in Florida. One airport is in a 'disaster' state. A Reinforcement Learning model that uses Q-Tables is developed in this code to train the airplane to land at a safe airport as closely as possible.

At the end of this file, a demonstration of the output and multiple graphs are created for the interpretation of results.

The initial environment was generated with inspiration and from [1] and adapted to fit our project's needs, while further information about reinforcement learning and the generation of graphs was aided by [2].
